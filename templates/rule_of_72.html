                <li>The thumb rule is a quick method to estimate the time needed for an investment to double in value terms.</li>
                <li>The Rule of 72 is calculated by dividing 72 by the annual rate of return.</li>
                <li>The Rule of 72 is a reliable approximation intended for "back of the envelope" math but the estimated number of years is still a mere approximation at the end of the day.</li>
